Day 16 - 3D Background Boxes
An interactive grid animation project when clicking the "Magic" button rotates the entire image by transforming a grid of boxes to create a visually appealing animation.

## What I Learned 

In CSS

1 How to split an image into multiple boxes using a background image and grid layout.

2 How to use background-size to fit the full image across a set of divided boxes.

3 How to animate the entire image using transform: rotate() on a container element.

4 How to control layout responsiveness using flex-wrap and box sizing.

5 Usage of ::before and ::after pseudo-elements for 3D-style depth effect.
