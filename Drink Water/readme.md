Day 7 - Drink Water 💧

A simple hydration reminder app designed to visually track daily water intake by clicking on small cups.

## What I Learned 

In JavaScript

1 Conditional Logic: Applied conditional checks to determine when to highlight or unhighlight cups.

2 Dynamic Styling: Used JavaScript to change CSS properties such as `visibility`, `height`, and `innerText` to provide real-time feedback.
