# Day 4 - Form Wave Animation

Learn how to create a stunning wave animation effect on form labels using JavaScript, making input fields visually engaging and interactive!

## What I Learned

In JavaScript

1 String .split('') — breaks a string into an array of individual characters.

2 .map() — loops through each character and wraps it in a <span> with a transition delay for the wave effect.

3 .join('') — joins the array of HTML strings back into a single HTML string.
