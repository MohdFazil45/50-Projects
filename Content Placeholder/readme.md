Day 11 - Content Placeholder

A shimmering content placeholder using CSS to simulate loading text and images.

## What I Learned 

 in  JavaScript

1  A **linear gradient** background (`.animated-bg`) simulates a moving light effect.
2  The **background-size** is set to `200%` to enable the sliding animation.
3  The **animation** (`bgPos`) moves the gradient left to right infinitely.
