Day 12 - Toast Notification
A simple project that shows popup notifications (toast messages) on the screen, which disappear after a few seconds automatically.

## What I Learned

In JavaScript:

1 How to show and remove elements dynamically using setTimeout().

2 How to get random choices from an array using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`.

3 How to use `classList.add()` and `notif.remove()` to show/hide notifications.

4 How to append elements using `appendChild()`.
