A simple JavaScript project that listens for keyboard events and displays the key, keyCode, and code of the pressed key on the screen.


## What I Learned

In JavaScript

- How to use `window.addEventListener` to listen for `keydown` events.
- How to dynamically update the DOM using `innerHTML`.
- The difference between `event.key`, `event.keyCode`, and `event.code`.
- The importance of ensuring the DOM is fully loaded before accessing elements.
