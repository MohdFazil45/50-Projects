Day 15 - Pokedex Project
A simple and responsive Pokedex web app. This project fetches and displays Pokémon data dynamically in a card layout, including Pokémon images, names, IDs, and types

## 🧠 What I Learned

1 Fetching data from a public API (`fetch`)
2 Dynamically creating DOM elements and injecting data
3 Using `map`, `forEach`, and `async/await`
